                Covalent bonding is when two or more elements share pairs of electrons in order to achieve a full outer shell<br>(they will become stable and stable is good).<br>
                This type of bonding occurs only between nonmetals.
                <br><br>
                Lets see an example for 2 oxygen atoms (both nonmetal):<br>
                <img src="images/oxygen_example.png" draggable="false" class="O_example_image">
                On the left side of the diagram, each oxygen atom has 6 electrons in its outer shell. Since an outer shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons, this means each oxygen atom needs 2 more electrons to fill its shell.
                <br><br>
                On the other side, the 2 oxygen atoms decided to share 2 pairs of electrons. By sharing like this, they both achieve a full outer shell with 8 electrons.
                <br><br>
                Why did they share 2 pairs of electrons instead of just 1 pair?<br> If the oxygens only shared 1 pair of electrons (1 electron from each atom), they would each have 7 electrons in their outer shell—not enough to reach 8. So, they decided to share another pair of electrons, which allows them to achieve their goal of 8 electrons in their outer shell.
                <br><br>    
                If you count up all the electrons around each oxygen atom (their own + the shared ones), you'll see that they both have 8 electrons now.

        <div class="ionic_bonding main_item bg">
            <div class="title">Ionic bonding</div>
            <div class="description">
                Ionic bonding is when two or more elements gain or lose electrons in order to achieve a full outer shell<br><br>
                This type of bonding occurs between nonmetals + metals. Since metals tend to lose electrons and nonmetals gain.
                <br><br>
                Lets see an example for sodium chloride (table salt):<br>
                <img src="images/NaCl_example.png" draggable="false" class="NaCl_example_image">
                On the left side of the diagram, you can see that a sodium atom has 1 electron in its outer shell. Since an outer shell needs 8 electrons to be full, sodium doesn’t need this electron—it actually wants to get rid of it to have a completely full outer shell below it.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, the chlorine atom has 7 electrons in its outer shell and it will only nees to gain 1 electron to achieve a full outer shell.
                <br><br>
                But instead of sharing their electrons, sodium will give away its 1 useless electron to chlorine who needs it. On the right side of the diagram, they will both have full outer shells. This is called an ionic bond.

            <div class="title">Metallic bonding</div>
            <div class="description">
                Metallic bonding is when a metal loses electrons and becomes an ion to achieve a full outer shell<br><br>
                This type of bonding occurs between metals + delocalised electrons. The delocalised electrons are the electrons the metal ions lost.
                <br><br>
                Lets see an example for magnesium:<br>
                <img src="images/metallic_magnesium.png" draggable="false" class="Mg_example_image">
                On the diagram the magnesium ions are the ones labeled by "+". The delocalised electrons, also called "the sea of delocalised electrons", are the smaller circles, and they have a negative charge.
                <br><br>
                These two make a metallic bond. The magnesium has a positive charge and is attracted the delocalised electrons.
                <br><br>
                Overall, instead of exchanging electrons, the magnesium atoms lost electrons and those electrons started moving freely between the now magnesium ions.
