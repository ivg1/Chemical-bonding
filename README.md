# Chemical-bonding
This is a website I made that contains a periodic table along with explanations of covalent & ionic bonding and how they work.
The periodic table shows all the elements scientists have discovered, and on every element there is a mass & nucleon (proton) number.

I used the syllabus of IGCSE Chemistry for this website, so some information might differ from higher level studies.
    (e.g. In IGCSE the syllabus states that all electron shells after the first shell have a max of 8 electrons, but in A level thats not true)
