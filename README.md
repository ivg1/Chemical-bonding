# Chemical-bonding
This is a website I made that contains a periodic table along with explanations of covalent, ionic bonding, metallic bonding and how they work.
The periodic table shows all the elements scientists have discovered, and on every element there is a mass & nucleon (proton) number.

This is meant to be educational for people who are interested in chemistry, and to provide an insight into chemical bonding.
I used the syllabus of IGCSE Chemistry for this website.
